1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
what we've done is uh

2
00:00:02.433 --> 00:00:04.866
kind of incredible and

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.966
and I think kind of documenting it is

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.900
is really important and sharing the world

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.633
we're so

6
00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:11.900
what we are now uh

7
00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:14.700
which is kind of unique is we're diverse

8
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.500
you know we have

9
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.833
we're a hodgepodge of people

10
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:17.600
the big word I

11
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.166
I know Ophelia is big on this word

12
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.833
we're all volunteers we don't get paid to do this

13
00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:25.166
we don't pay to do this but

14
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.266
we're volunteers

15
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:29.266
that advocate on behalf of marginalized people

16
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.200
that get caught in the criminal legal system

17
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.266
we're trying to improve indigent defense

18
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.700
we're making sure everyone who gets arrested

19
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.100
gets provided counsel

20
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.333
before they face the judge for the first time

21
00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:42.600
and you know that that session goes by various

22
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.566
various names

23
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.433
but we're kind of stuck on first appearance

24
00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:49.000
as being the operative one

25
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.466
that people seem to understand the best

26
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.466
but if I say magistration or bond hearing

27
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.966
I'm talking about the same stuff

28
00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:57.533
and we're also working to provide better alternatives

29
00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:00.000
for people encountering the criminal legal system

30
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.866
who need mental health care
